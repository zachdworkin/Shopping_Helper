2.0 Unit(s): Scallions
1.0 Tablespoon(s): Fry Seasoning
6.0 Tablespoon(s): Sour Cream

Instructions
Step 1: Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Step 2: Wash and dry all produce.
Step 3: Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick pieces.
Step 4: dice potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces (no need to peel).
Step 5: Trim and thinly slice scallions separating whites from greens.
Step 6: Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, half the fry seasoning, salt, and pepper.
Step 7: Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-25 minutes.
Step 8: While carrots roast, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Boil until tender, 15-20 minutes.
Step 9: Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid; drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with 1 packet sour cream and 1 TBSP butter until smooth, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. Stir in half the scallion greens. Season with salt and pepper. Keep covered off of heat.
Step 10: Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper.
Step 11: Place 1 TBSP butter in a shallow microwave safe dish. Microwave until melted, 30 second. Stir in panko, Frank's Red Hot Original Seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
Step 12: Brush 1 packet sour cream onto tops of chicken in a thin layer. Working one piece at a time, dip brushed sides of chicken into panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).
Step 13: Place coated sides up on a second, lightly oiled backing sheet.
Step 14: Roast chicken on middle rack until cooked through, 15-18 minutes. Transfer to a plate to rest.
Step 15: While chicken cooks, in a small bowl, combine blue cheese dressing scallion whites, and remaining sour cream.
Step 16: Divide carrots, potatoes, and chicken between plates. Top chicken with blue cheese sauce, remaining scallion greens, and hot sauce if desired. Serve with any remaining blue cheese sauce on the side.
